### About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues with storage or cache:

```bash
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

### Database Connection Issues

Ensure your MySQL/MariaDB server is running and the credentials in `.env` are correct.

### Artisan Command Not Found

Make sure you're in the project root directory when running artisan commands.

### Role Issues

If you encounter "Target class [role] does not exist" error, check that:
1. The `spatie/laravel-permission` package is installed and configured correctly
2. The Role model exists and is properly namespaced
3. The `config/permission.php` file has the correct model mapping
